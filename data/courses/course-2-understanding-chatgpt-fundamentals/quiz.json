        "D) Tone"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "The 'Context' component is where you provide all the necessary background information, such as the target audience, goals, constraints, and any other details the AI needs to produce a tailored and relevant response.",
      "difficulty": "easy",
      "conceptTested": "Practical Application"
    },
    {
      "questionNumber": 6,
      "question": "What is the primary benefit of using 'Chain-of-Thought' prompting?",
      "type": "mcq",
      "options": [
        "A) It makes the AI's response shorter.",
        "B) It improves the AI's ability to reason through multi-step problems.",
        "C) It guarantees a factually correct answer.",
        "D) It forces the AI to use a specific persona."
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B",
      "explanation": "By asking the AI to 'think step-by-step,' Chain-of-Thought prompting forces the model to break down a problem and show its work. This externalized reasoning process significantly increases the chances of arriving at a correct or logical conclusion for complex tasks.",
      "difficulty": "medium",
      "conceptTested": "Core Concept 2"
    },
    {

        "A) 'Write a marketing email.'",
        "B) 'Write a marketing email for our new productivity app, 'FocusFlow'.'",
        "C) 'Act as an expert email marketer. Write a 3-part email drip campaign to launch our new app, 'FocusFlow'. The target audience is freelance creatives who struggle with time management. The tone should be inspiring and empathetic. The goal is to get them to sign up for a free trial.'",
        "D) 'Our new app is called 'FocusFlow'. Please create some marketing content for it, like an email.'"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "C",
      "explanation": "Option C is the strongest prompt because it effectively uses all elements of the P.A.C.T. framework. It defines a Persona (expert email marketer), a clear Action (write a 3-part campaign), rich Context (app name, target audience, their pain points, campaign goal), and a specific Tone (inspiring and empathetic).

      ],
      "correctAnswer": "D",
      "explanation": "This scenario tests the 'Never Trust, Always Verify' principle. The most responsible action is to treat the AI's output as unverified and cross-check the specific fact (a world record) with an authoritative, independent source. Asking the AI to check itself is unreliable, and simply assuming it's wrong or right are both poor practices.",
